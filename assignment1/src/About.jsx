        <p>Billionaire playboy Tony Stark 
        is one of the most wealthy and intelligent people on
         Earth (especially as HE tells it). 
         When he is kidnapped by terrorists and forced to 
         make his company's weapons for them, he instead 
         creates his first Iron Man suit, which he uses to 
         escape.  From that day on, he dedicated his life 
         and fortune to fighting crime as the hero known as 
         the Iron Man.</p>
